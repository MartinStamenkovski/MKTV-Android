# MKTV-Android

Watch IP TV channels on your Android device.   
**You may need to use VPN for certain channels.**

Current channels can be viewed [here](https://martinstamenkovski.github.io/TV-JSON/mk/tv.json). 

You can download the apk file from [releases](https://github.com/MartinStamenkovski/MKTV-Android/releases).

## Why?
Because I know people who are watching TV on their phone and to do that they are watching on the website, so I made them a native Android application.

## iOS Version?
I'm not sure, because it should be on the AppStore for most people and I don't want trouble with legal stuff for that :) 

## Legal
I don't own anything I'm just showing the content.
