# MKTV-Android

Watch Macedonian TV channels on your Android device.   
**For those who are not in Macedonia you need to use VPN.**

You can download the apk file from [releases](https://github.com/MartinStamenkovski/MKTV-Android/releases).

Current channels can be found [here](https://github.com/MartinStamenkovski/TV-JSON).

The stream files are used from [A1 Web TV](https://webtv.a1.mk/)

## Why?
Because I know people who are watching TV on their phone and are going on the web, so I made them a native Android application.

### Legal
I don't own anything I'm just showing the content from [A1 Web TV](https://webtv.a1.mk/)
